So in order to interact easily with the emualted device, i needed some way to be root on the device. I found a way to do this:

https://github.com/newbit1/rootAVD

The project is called AVDroot and is available on github. It is a simple shell script that will give you root access to the emulator. It is very easy to use, just download the script and run it. It will give you a root shell on the emulator.

I first needed to get and emulated device with API 27 (Android 8.1) running. 

I then ran the script and got Magisk installed on the device.

then using adb root, i was able to get a root shell on the device.

adb install /path/to/app.apk
